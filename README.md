# Assignment1-PCD

Professor provided us a sequential program which simulate the behaviour of N bodies inside a field.
The program simulate the movement of the bodies through computation of repulsive force between them.
The computation number is very high with a large amount of bodies, so the simulation is slow.
Our goal is to provide a concurrent solution in order to speed it up.
